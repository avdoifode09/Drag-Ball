"Drag Ball - The Memory Game" is an immersive and challenging puzzle game designed to test players' memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Set within a grid-based world of 14x14 dimensions, players embark on a quest to guide a white ball from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The journey, however, is fraught with unseen obstacles strategically placed throughout the grid.
Players must rely on their memory and observation skills to remember the locations of these obstacles, as collision with any obstacle resets the ball to its starting position. With each reset, players must devise new strategies to navigate the grid and reach the goal.
The game offers a range of difficulty levels, allowing players to tailor the challenge to their skill level. Whether you're a novice looking to hone your memory skills or a seasoned puzzle enthusiast seeking a new challenge, "Drag Ball" offers an engaging and rewarding experience for all.
