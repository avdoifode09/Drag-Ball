"Drag Ball - The Memory Game" is an immersive and challenging puzzle game designed to test players' memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Set within a grid-based world of 14x14 dimensions, players embark on a quest to guide a white ball from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The journey, however, is fraught with unseen obstacles strategically placed throughout the grid.
